                <p>
                    I am a PhD candidate in Community Health at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I work with
                    Dr. Chung-Yi Chiu in the area of digital health interventions and human-computer interaction for
                    health. My research focuses on designing patient portals and mHealth solutions that support digital
                    health-seeking behavior, self-efficacy, and sustained engagement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have developed digital platforms and conducted implementation research projects in Bangladesh. Now
                    I contribute to multiple NIH-funded projects on AI-supported health tools. Before this, I completed
                    my bachelor in Dentistry and was a licensed dentist in Bangladesh.

            <h2>Enhancing Cervical & Breast Cancer Screening in Bangladesh</h2>
            <p>
                This project introduced an eco-friendly bamboo-based toolkit for VIA and CBE. An 8-day training program
                was organized for healthcare providers in Khulna and Satkhira Maternal and Child Welfare Centres.
                Providers were trained on performing VIA and CBE, patient counseling, peer motivation, and digital data
                management.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mentorship was provided through hybrid sessions with master trainers, and infrastructural support helped
                re-establish screening centres that had paused during COVID-19. The intervention received positive
                feedback and has strong potential for nationwide scale-up.

            <h2>Friendship 3-Tier Health Program Evaluation</h2>
            <p>
                Friendship’s health program addresses gaps in primary and secondary care in remote char and coastal
                areas using a three-tier approach:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tier 1: Community Health Workers provide basic preventive services, health education, and referrals
                    at the household level.</li>
                <li>Tier 2: Satellite clinics and trained paramedics deliver primary healthcare and maternal, newborn,
                    and child health services.</li>
                <li>Tier 3: Floating Hospitals and referral centers ensure access to specialized medical care and
                    surgical services.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Our evaluation examined service coverage, patient satisfaction, referral efficiency, and health
                outcomes.
                The program demonstrated improvements in immunization uptake, antenatal and postnatal care, and early
                detection of diseases.
            </p>
            <p>
                Findings highlighted the importance of community engagement, integrated referral pathways, and
                telemedicine support for sustainability.

            <h2>Mukhorito: Adolescent SRHR mHealth Platform</h2>
            <p>
                Mukhorito is an mHealth intervention addressing the lack of accessible, adolescent-friendly SRHR
                information in Bangladesh. The app was developed using a co-design process with adolescents, educators,
                and health experts, ensuring relevance and cultural sensitivity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Guided by the Intervention Mapping framework and the Health Action Process Approach, Mukhorito
                integrates
                evidence-based behavior change strategies with engaging digital features:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Interactive learning modules on SRHR, gender, and relationships</li>
                <li>Peer discussion forums and Q&A with experts</li>
                <li>Gamified quizzes and challenges</li>
                <li>Anonymous, stigma-free access to resources</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                A pilot evaluation showed significant improvements in SRHR knowledge and awareness. Collaboration with
                the Bangladesh government and private investors supported sustainability and scale-up.

                        Health.

                        The model trains community medic aides, uses mHealth for 24/7 doctor access, paramedics for
                        monthly services, and hospital ships for specialized care.
