            <h2>Enhancing Cervical & Breast Cancer Screening in Bangladesh</h2>
            <p>
                This project introduced an eco-friendly bamboo-based toolkit for VIA (Visual Inspection with
                Acetic Acid) and CBE (Clinical Breast Examination). An 8-day training program was
                organized
                for healthcare providers in Khulna and Satkhira Maternal and Child Welfare Centres. Providers were
                trained on
                performing VIA and CBE, patient counseling, peer motivation, and digital data management.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mentorship was provided through hybrid sessions with master trainers, and infrastructural support was
                extended
                to re-establish screening centres that had paused during COVID-19. The intervention received positive
                feedback
                on feasibility and usability and has strong potential for nationwide scale-up.

            <h2>Friendship 3-Tier Health Program Evaluation</h2>
            <p>
                Friendship’s health program addresses gaps in primary and secondary care in remote char
                (river island) and coastal areas using a three-tier approach:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tier 1: Community Health Workers (CHWs) provide basic preventive services,
                    health education, and referrals at the household level.</li>
                <li>Tier 2: Satellite clinics and trained paramedics deliver primary healthcare
                    and maternal, newborn, and child health services.</li>
                <li>Tier 3: Friendship Floating Hospitals and referral centers ensure access to
                    specialized medical care and surgical services.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Our evaluation examined service coverage, patient satisfaction, referral efficiency, and
                health outcomes. The program demonstrated strong improvements in immunization uptake,
                antenatal and postnatal care access, and early detection of communicable and non-communicable diseases.
            </p>
            <p>
                Findings highlighted the importance of community engagement, integrated referral pathways,
                and telemedicine support for sustainability. The model offers a scalable blueprint for
                strengthening health systems in climate-vulnerable, underserved populations.

            <h2>Mukhorito: Adolescent SRHR mHealth Platform</h2>
            <p>
                Mukhorito is an innovative mHealth intervention that addresses the
                lack of accessible, adolescent-friendly sexual and reproductive health (SRHR) information
                in Bangladesh. The app was developed using a participatory co-design process
                with adolescents, educators, and health experts, ensuring content relevance and cultural
                sensitivity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Guided by the Intervention Mapping framework and the
                Health Action Process Approach (HAPA), Mukhorito integrates
                evidence-based behavior change strategies with engaging digital features, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Interactive learning modules on SRHR, gender, and relationships</li>
                <li>Peer discussion forums and Q&A with experts</li>
                <li>Gamified quizzes and challenges to reinforce learning</li>
                <li>Anonymous, stigma-free access to information and resources</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In a pilot evaluation, Mukhorito demonstrated significant improvements in SRHR knowledge
                and awareness among adolescents. Collaboration with the Bangladesh government and
                private investors supported sustainability and scale-up, making Mukhorito a
                pioneering example of technology-driven adolescent health promotion.

                    <p>
                        Excited to share two co-authored papers evaluating the "Welcome Person"
                        intervention in Bangladesh.
                        This simple, non-clinical support role was designed to greet and guide patients, transforming
                        maternal care
                        experiences in overstretched facilities.
                        Quantitative findings showed improved satisfaction and interpersonal care
                        scores. Qualitative insights revealed how mothers, families, and providers felt a new sense of
                        warmth,
                        trust,
                        and dignity in facilities.

                    <p>
                        Together, these studies highlight the power of low-cost, culturally resonant interventions to
                        make
                        healthcare more humane.
